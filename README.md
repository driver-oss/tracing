# Driver Tracing Library

A vendor-neutral, pure-Scala [1] tracing library for Akka-HTTP.

[1] Pure-Scala, in this context, refers to no direct Java library
dependencies. Dependencies are kept to a minimum, however it is
possible that Java libraries may be included transitively.

This library provides tracing directives for Akka-HTTP. It specifies
common client abstractions and implementations that may be used with
different tracing solutions, such as Google Stackdriver Tracing.
